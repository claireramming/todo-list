First react app, created while learning "Learn React for Free" on Scrimba. 
*UPDATED* 9/10/21 - after completing more of the Front End Career Path from Scrimba I have revisited this app and made some major updates. I based my updates on the styling and functionality available in Asana, which is my personal favorite task app for everyday use. 

Changes from Scrimba version:
- style changes *UPDATE: it looks pretty now!
- can add a task to the end of the list *UPDATE: added to flow of tasks so it acts more like a notepad
- a button for each task to remove it from the list
- *UPDATE: can also delete tasks by clearing out text and hitting backspace/delete
- *UPDATE: editable tasks! click to edit (self coded), enter (self coded), or click away (react-foco) to exit edit mode
